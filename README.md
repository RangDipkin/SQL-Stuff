dijkstra.sql  -- Given some table called 'graph' which represents an undirected, weighted graph; this algorithm reads 
                 some vertex as a parameter, then calculates the shortest path to every other vertex on the graph. Make 
                 sure that the 'graph' table follows this format: (vertex1 integer, vertex2 integer, weight double).

leaves.sql    -- Given some tree called 'tree', this algorithm reads some node as a parameter, then returns all 
                 descendants of that node.  Make sure that 'tree' follows this format: (parent integer, child integer).
